Agricultureencompasses crop andlivestock...,"Agricultureencompasses crop andlivestockproduction,aquaculture, andforestryfor food and non-food products. Agriculture was a key factor in the rise ofsedentaryhumancivilization, whereby farming ofdomesticatedspecies created foodsurplusesthat enabled people to live in cities. While humans started gathering grains at least 105,000 years ago, nascent farmers only began planting them around 11,500 years ago. Sheep, goats, pigs, and cattle were domesticated around 10,000 years ago. Plants were independently cultivated in at least 11 regions of the world. In the 20th century,industrial agriculturebased on large-scalemonoculturescame to dominate agricultural output."

The largest 1% of farms in the world are greater than 50 hectares (120 acres) and operate more than 70% of the world's farmland. Nearly 40% of agricultural land is found on farms larger than 1,000 hectares (2,500 acres). However, five of every six farms in the world consist of fewer than 2 hectares (4.9 acres), and take up only around 12% of all agricultural land. Farms and farming greatly influencerural economicsand greatly shaperural society, effecting both the directagricultural workforceand broaderbusinessesthat support the farms and farming populations."

Food classes includecereals(grains),vegetables,fruits,cooking oils,meat,milk,eggs, andfungi. Global agricultural production amounts to approximately 11 billion tonnes of food, 32 million tonnes of natural fibers and 4 billion m3of wood. However, around 14% of the world's food is lost from production before reaching the retail level."

Agricultural economics began as a branch of economics that specifically dealt withland usage. It focused on maximizing thecrop yieldwhile maintaining a goodsoil ecosystem.  Throughout the 20th century the discipline expanded and the current scope of the discipline is much broader.Agriculturaleconomics today includes a variety of applied areas, having considerable overlap with conventional economics.[1][2][3][4]Agricultural economists have made substantial contributions to research in economics,econometrics,development economics, andenvironmental economics.  Agricultural economics influencesfood policy,agricultural policy, andenvironmental policy."
Economics has been defined as the study ...,"Economics has been defined as the study of resource allocation underscarcity. Agricultural economics, or the application of economic methods to optimize the decisions made by agricultural producers, grew to prominence around the turn of the 20th century.  The field of agricultural economics can be traced back to works on land economics.Henry Charles Taylorwas the greatest contributor in this period, with the establishment of the Department of Agricultural Economics at theUniversity of Wisconsinin 1909.[5]"

The discipline was closely linked to empirical applications of mathematical statistics and made early and significant contributions to econometric methods.  In the 1960s and afterwards, as agricultural sectors in theOECDcountries contracted, agricultural economists were drawn to the development problems of poor countries, to the trade andmacroeconomicpolicy implications of agriculture in rich countries, and to a variety of production, consumption, and environmental and resource problems.[8]"

"In the field of environmental economics,...","In the field of environmental economics, agricultural economists have contributed in three main areas: designing incentives to control environmentalexternalities(such aswater pollution due to agricultural production), estimating the value of non-market benefits from natural resources and environmental amenities (such as an appealing rural landscape), and the complex interrelationship between economic activities and environmental consequences.[16]With regard to natural resources, agricultural economists have developed quantitative tools for improving land management,preventing erosion,managing pests, protecting biodiversity, and preventinglivestock diseases.[17]"
"While at one time, the field of agricult...","While at one time, the field of agricultural economics was focused primarily on farm-level issues, in recent years agricultural economists have studied diverse topics related to the economics of food consumption. In addition to economists' long-standing emphasis on the effects of prices and incomes, researchers in this field have studied how information and quality attributes influenceconsumer behavior. Agricultural economists have contributed to understanding how households make choices between purchasing food or preparing it at home, howfood pricesare determined, definitions ofpoverty thresholds, how consumers respond to price and income changes in a consistent way, and survey and experimental tools for understanding consumer preferences.[18]"
Agricultural economics research has addr...,"Agricultural economics research has addresseddiminishing returnsin agricultural production, as well as farmers' costs and supply responses. Much research has applied economic theory to farm-level decisions. Studies of risk and decision-making under uncertainty have real-world applications tocrop insurancepolicies and to understanding how farmers in developing countries make choices about technology adoption. These topics are important for understanding prospects for producing sufficient food for agrowing world population, subject to new resource and environmental challenges such aswater scarcityandglobal climate change.[19]"
Development economics is broadly concern...,"Development economics is broadly concerned with the improvement of living conditions in low-income countries, and the improvement of economic performance in low-income settings. Because agriculture is a large part of most developing economies, both in terms of employment and share of GDP, agricultural economists have been at the forefront of empirical research on development economics, contributing to our understanding of agriculture's role in economic development, economic growth and structural transformation. Many agricultural economists are interested in thefood systemsof developing economies, the linkages between agriculture and nutrition, and the ways in which agriculture interact with other domains, such as the natural environment.[20][21]"

Modern farms in developed countries are ...,"Modern farms in developed countries are highly mechanized. In the United States, livestock may be raised onrangelandand finished infeedlots, and the mechanization of crop production has brought about a great decrease in the number of agricultural workers needed. In Europe, traditional family farms are giving way to larger production units. In Australia, some farms are very large because the land is unable to support a high stocking density of livestock because of climatic conditions. In less developed countries, small farms are the norm, and the majority of rural residents aresubsistence farmers, feeding their families and selling any surplus products in the local market."
The word in the sense of an agricultural...,"The word in the sense of an agricultural land-holding derives from the verb ""to farm"" a revenue source, whether taxes, customs, rents of a group of manors or simply to hold an individual manor by thefeudal land tenureof ""fee farm"". The word is from the medieval Latin nounfirma, also the source of the French wordferme, meaning a fixed agreement, contract,[3]from the classical Latin adjectivefirmusmeaning strong, stout, firm.[4][5]As in the medieval age virtually all manors were engaged in the business of agriculture, which was their principal revenue source, so to hold a manor by the tenure of ""fee farm"" became synonymous with the practice of agriculture itself."

The transition fromhunter-gathererto settled, agricultural societies is called theNeolithic Revolutionand first began around 12,000 years ago, near the beginning of thegeologicalepochof theHolocene[7]around 12,000 years ago.[8]It was the world's first historically verifiable revolution in agriculture. Farming spread from the Middle East to Europe and by 4,000 BC people that lived in the central part of Europe were usingoxento pull plows and wagons.[9]Subsequent step-changes in human farming practices were provoked by theBritish Agricultural Revolutionin the 18th century, and theGreen Revolutionof the second half of the 20th century."

It may have started about 12,000 years ago with the domestication of livestock in theFertile Crescentin western Asia, soon to be followed by the cultivation of crops. Modern units tend to specialize in the crops or livestock best suited to the region, with their finished products being sold for the retail market or for further processing, with farm products being traded around the world."

Medievalfeudalismwas essentially a system that centralized control of farmland, control of farm labor and political power, while the early American democracy, in which land ownership was a prerequisite for voting rights, was built on relatively easy paths to individual farm ownership. However, the gradual modernization and mechanization of farming, which greatly increases both the efficiency and capital requirements of farming, has led to increasingly large farms. This has usually been accompanied by the decoupling of political power from farm ownership.[citation needed]"

They classify soils and test them to determine whether they contain nutrients vital to plant growth. Such nutritional substances include compounds ofnitrogen,phosphorus, andpotassium. If a certain soil is deficient in these substances,fertilizersmay provide them. Agricultural soil scientists investigate the movement ofnutrientsthrough the soil, and the amount of nutrients absorbed by a plant'sroots. Agricultural soil scientists also examine the development of roots and their relation to the soil. Some agricultural soil scientists try to understand the structure and function of soils in relation to soil fertility. They grasp the structure of soil as porous solid. The solid frames of soil consist of mineral derived from the rocks and organic matter originated from the dead bodies of various organisms. The pore space of the soil is essential for the soil to become productive. Small pores serve as water reservoir supplying water to plants and other organisms in the soil during the rain-less period. The water in the small pores of soils is not pure water; they call it soil solution. In soil solution, various plant nutrients derived from minerals and organic matters in the soil are there. This is measured through thecation exchange capacity. Large pores serve as water drainage pipe to allow the excessive water pass through the soil, during the heavy rains. They also serve as air tank to supply oxygen to plant roots  and other living beings in the soil."

Plant breeding has increasedcrop yieldsand has improved thenutritional valueof numerous crops, includingcorn,soybeans, andwheat. It has also resulted in the development of new types of plants. For example, ahybridgrain namedtriticalewas produced by crossbreeding rye and wheat. Triticale contains more usableproteinthan does either rye or wheat. Agronomy has also been instrumental for fruit and vegetable production research. Furthermore, the application of plant breeding for turfgrass development has resulted in a reduction in the demand for fertilizer and water inputs (requirements), as well as turf-types with higher disease resistance."

They classify soils and analyze them to determine whether they contain nutrients vital for plant growth. Common macronutrients analyzed include compounds ofnitrogen,phosphorus,potassium,calcium,magnesium, andsulfur. Soil is also assessed for several micronutrients, likezincandboron. The percentage of organic matter,soil pH, and nutrient holding capacity (cation exchange capacity) are tested in a regional laboratory. Agronomists will interpret these laboratory reports and make recommendations to modify soil nutrients for optimal plant growth.[2]"
"Additionally, agronomists develop method...","Additionally, agronomists develop methods to preserve soil and decrease the effects of [erosion] by wind and water. For example, a technique known ascontour plowingmay be used to prevent soil erosion and conserve rainfall. Researchers of agronomy also seek ways to use the soil more effectively for solving other problems. Such problems include the disposal of human and animalmanure,water pollution, andpesticideaccumulation in the soil, as well as preserving the soil for future generations such as the burning of paddocks after crop production. Pasture management techniques includeno-till farming, planting of soil-binding grasses along contours on steep slopes, and using contour drains of depths as much as 1 metre.[3]"
